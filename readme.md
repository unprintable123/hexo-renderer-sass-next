# hexo-renderer-sass-next

Add [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) support for [Hexo](https://hexo.io/).

Support function `url_for, hexo-config, hexo-theme-config` for accessing hexo configs and url resolving.

> Dart Sass is the primary implementation of Sass, which means it gets new features before any other implementation. It's fast, easy to install, and it compiles to pure JavaScript which makes it easy to integrate into modern web development workflows. Find out more or help out with its development on GitHub.
